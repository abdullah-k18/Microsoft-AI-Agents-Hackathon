# üß† DEV Community Blog Creator ‚Äî AI Agents Hackathon Submission

Welcome to **DEV Community Blog Creator**, a Streamlit application powered by multi-agent collaboration via [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/). This project is my submission for the **Microsoft AI Agents Hackathon** and demonstrates how LLM agents can collaborate to research, write, and polish a professional-quality blog post based on any given topic.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This app simulates a real-world content creation pipeline using three AI agents:

- **Content Planner**: Researches the topic and creates an outline.
- **Content Writer**: Writes the full blog post based on the planner's output.
- **Editor**: Polishes and proofreads the blog post to ensure it meets editorial standards.

The result is a well-structured blog post ready for publication.

## üß† How It Works

| Agent           | Role Description                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content Planner** | Gathers insights, defines the audience, and outlines the blog structure         |
| **Content Writer**  | Writes a structured post using the planner's outline and SEO recommendations     |
| **Editor**          | Refines tone, grammar, and flow for final publishing                            |

All tasks are managed and executed using the **CrewAI** framework, which enables LLM agents to work collaboratively.
